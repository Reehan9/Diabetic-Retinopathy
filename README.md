    <h1>Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Project</h1>
    <p>Diabetic Retinopathy is an ocular disorder that can result in loss of vision and even blindness among individuals with diabetes. The condition specifically affects the blood vessels located in the retina. Therefore, it is really important to cure this disease and undergo specific treatment. It is crucial to diagnose diabetic retinopathy early and receive prompt medical treatment in order to prevent the serious consequences associated with the condition. This can help to minimize the harmful effects of diabetic retinopathy on vision and overall eye health.</p>
    <h2>The Need for Improvement</h2>
    <p>Manual detection of Diabetic Retinopathy by ophthalmologists is very time consuming, hence there is a need to improvise on the current method of treatment. This work focuses on providing a way to detect the disease at a very early stage, so that complications do not arise in the later stages.</p>
    <h2>Data Source</h2>
 <p>The dataset used was taken from Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmologist Society (APTOS).</p>
    <h2>Proposed Work and Technology Used</h2>
    <p>The proposed work was mainly implemented using the Inception V3 neural network engine. Inception V3 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture from Google. It's particularly useful for image classification tasks, due to its ability to make use of complex patterns to recognize objects in an image. The result shows that the proposed model achieved 79% accuracy in detecting Diabetic Retinopathy.</p>
